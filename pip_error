  Running setup.py install for vext.gi ... done
  DEPRECATION: vext.gi was installed using the legacy 'setup.py install' method, because a wheel could not be built for it. pip 23.1 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to fix the wheel build issue reported above. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8368
